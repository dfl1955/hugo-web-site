Hugo is a general-purpose website framework. More accurately speaking, Hugo is a static page site generator. Here are my notes, copied from [my wiki](http://wiki.davelevy.info/hugo). …

This page is hosted on AWS/S3

## Two lessons,
1. On Ubuntu, the current advice is, don’t use apt-get, at least not on AWS. it’s very old and doesn’t work, use the release code and dpkg.
2. The review function is tightly bound to 127.0.0.1:1313. Best not use AWS EC2 as a dev. platform, unless you have a graphic desktop. I am now using virtual box.
