# my first hugo web site

this is based on ananke theme and aimed to be hosted at davelevy.cc

it is a very simple adaptation of ananke, the candudate site is held in ../public

in order to get it to work I needed to amend the css lines which are absolute; I suspect that
baseURL might have fixed the problem but I need to read more.
